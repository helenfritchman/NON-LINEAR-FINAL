          In 1993 for the first time, the World Wide Web became open to public
          access. Within the years that followed, computers would become more
          and more commonly found in the home. With these new technologies
          digital texts were becoming more prevalent and professionals working
          in technology, languages, and the social sciences were assessing new
          trends in the hopes of forecasting the future of print and digital
          media. There was some concern that books would become overshadowed by
          other modes of representation with the coming of the digital age. With
          such a large change came fear about the future of print and its
          relevance. Yet, there was also hope and excitement for the
          possibilities to come. For the first time, digitized information had
          the ability to materialize connections within texts that were
          previously only able to be accessed through the imagination. There was
          optimism in the prospect of ascertaining a higher level of
          understanding of the context than that which was possible through
          physical text. Now, with the ability of designs such as the hyperlink,
          it was more efficient to create networks of connections between
          information in digital texts. In the 1995 publication Being Digital,
          Nicholas Negroponte wrote that some viewed hypertexts as removing the
          limitations of the printed page. While digitization and hypertexts
          have removed some constraints of the physical text they have also
          introduced new dilemmas. <br />
          <br />
          Print media provided constraints that usually lead to a linear reading
          of the material. Books, for example, provide a distinct beginning and
          end to the reader. They give the reader a procedure to follow and
          provide a fairly stable representation of the sequence given by rules
          set by both the author and the structure of the book itself. However,
          now with digital media and the use of hyperlinks users have more
          agency in their path of understanding and are allowed to dictate what
          information they gain. While they are more easily able to manifest the
          connections hoped for in the initial digitization process there is a
          danger that comes with the viewer's choice of connections that has led
          to the possibility of misinformation.
